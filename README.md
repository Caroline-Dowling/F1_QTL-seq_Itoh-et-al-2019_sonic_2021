# F1 QTL-seq pipeline by Itoh _et al._ 2019, modified by Dowling _et al._ 2023 
QTL mapping was performed on _Cannabis sativa_ to identify the locus conferring photoperiod-insensitive flowering time in hemp. This modified QTL-seq approach combines bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) including the sequencing data of the F1 to aid QTL mapping in highly heterozygous species (Itoh et al., 2019).
